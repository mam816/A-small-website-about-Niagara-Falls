<p style="color:white;font-size:12pt;text-align:center">Niagara Falls is partly in <b>New York and Ontario,Canada</b>. The water falls was named this because of the escarpment the water was running off of-the Niagara escarpment.
This escarpment runs through the territory Ontario and the states of New York,Michigan,Wisconsin,and Illinois. This natural beauty is also used as a <b>hydroelectricity conductor</b>,
and has been since the late 19th century thanks to<span Style="color:#ff0040"> Nikola Tesla</span>. A little background history about the falls is that it was initially created by large ice sheets that once were in southern Ontario about 18,000 years ago that melted and soon formed the now known falls.
Niagara Falls is made up of three separate parts: <span style="color:#ff0040">the American Falls, the Canadian Falls(also known as the Horseshoe Falls), and Bridal Veil Falls</span>. 
The average width of the whole thing including the three different falls comes to about 3,950ft and the total length.However,each fall has a different height. The longest is the Canadian falls at 167ft;then the American and Bridal Veil both have the same 90 to 120ft height. </p>

<p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;text-align:center"> There have been many books and movies that have included this natural phenomenon. The first movie, which may surprise
you is a Disney fan favorite:<i><u><span style="color:rgb(255,0,64)">Wall-E</i></u></span>. Some of the sounds in the movie were derived from the falls themselves to make Wall-E come alive. The adorable little robot’s world was not only made from visual effects, but also something that is familiar to everyone. Another movie that captures the essence of
Niagara Falls and the Niagara river is the self-titled<i><u><span style="color:rgb(255,0,64)"> Niagara</i></u></span>, which stars the well renowned Marilyn Monroe. One book I would recommend to check out about Niagara is called<i>
Queen of the Mist: The Forgotten Heroine of Niagara.</i> It is about a woman that performed a death defying stunt and lived to see the next day.One last book that might interest you if you like adventure is called<i> In the Mad Water: Two Centuries of Adventure and Lunacy at Niagara Falls</i>. If you are a person who finds adventure intriguing and exhilarating, this may be a good book for you to check out.</p>
